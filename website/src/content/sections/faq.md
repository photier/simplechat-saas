# FAQ List
list:
  - title: Why Telegram? Why not a traditional chat panel like Zendesk or Intercom?
    description: Because Telegram is faster, more stable, and handles billions of messages daily without breaking a sweat. No app crashes, no slow dashboards, no sync issues. Your team already uses Telegram - why force them into another clunky tool? Plus, it's mobile-first, so you can reply from anywhere instantly.
    active: true
  - title: What does "unlimited seats" actually mean?
    description: It means exactly that. Add 5 support agents or 50 - same price. Just invite people to your Telegram group and they're automatically part of your support team. No per-user fees, no seat management panels, no surprises on your bill. Scale freely.
  - title: How does the topic-based organization work in Telegram?
    description: Each website visitor gets their own topic thread in your Telegram group. Think of it like organized email threads, but instant. Your team sees all conversations clearly separated - no chaos, no mixing up customers. It's beautifully simple and efficient.
  - title: Do I need AI, or can I just use human agents?
    description: Totally up to you! The BASIC plan ($9.99/month) is pure human support via Telegram - no AI required. If you want AI to handle repetitive questions 24/7, add the AI Add-On for $19.99/month. You're not forced to pay for features you don't need.
  - title: How fast is the setup really?
    description: 60 seconds, honestly. Copy widget code → paste on website → connect Telegram group → invite your team. Done. No complex integrations, no technical knowledge needed. If you can copy-paste, you can install SimpleChat.
  - title: What if my team isn't familiar with Telegram?
    description: If your team uses any modern messenger app (WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage), they'll master Telegram in 5 minutes. It's intuitive, fast, and works on every device. Plus, Telegram is used by 900M+ people worldwide - chances are they already know it.
  - title: Can I use this for multiple websites?
    description: Each subscription covers one website. Need support for multiple sites? Just get additional subscriptions - each one is only $9.99/month with unlimited seats. Or contact us for custom enterprise pricing if you're managing many domains.
  - title: What happens after my 7-day free trial?
    description: If you do nothing, your widget stays active but conversations stop flowing to Telegram. To keep it running, upgrade to BASIC ($9.99/month). All your data and settings are preserved - just activate your plan and you're back online instantly.
  - title: Is my customer data secure on Telegram?
    description: Yes. Telegram uses bank-grade encryption and is trusted by governments and enterprises worldwide. Your conversation data is stored securely, and you control who has access via your Telegram group permissions. We never sell or share customer data.
  - title: Can I cancel anytime?
    description: Absolutely. No contracts, no penalties. Cancel from your dashboard and you won't be charged again. Your service continues until the end of your current billing period. We believe in earning your business every month, not trapping you in contracts.
